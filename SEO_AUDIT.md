No redirect chains found in code. No orphan templates; nav and internal links reach all key pages. Trailing slash policy: no trailing slash; canonicals set accordingly.

## Key issues and fixes
- **Missing crawl directives and sitemap (Critical)** – Added `src/app/robots.ts` and `src/app/sitemap.ts`; robots now references sitemap and host, allowing full crawl while excluding nothing important. Sitemap only lists canonical, indexable URLs.
- **No canonical strategy (Critical)** – Set `metadataBase` and per-page canonicals; default Open Graph/Twitter metadata added (`src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/lib/seo.ts`). Avoids slash/case duplication and improves share previews (`public/og-default.png`).
- **No structured data (High)** – Added Organization + WebSite JSON-LD globally; BreadcrumbList emitted on every page; Product/SoftwareApplication + FAQ schema on the pillar (`ai-dmx-controller`) and FAQ page; TechArticle on technical page.
- **Thin/untargeted content for “AI DMX Controller” (High)** – Rewrote home, about, technical, FAQ, privacy, pilot pages to English with clean copy; created pillar, comparison, use-case, and guide clusters aligned to target queries and internal linking.
- **Weak internal linking (High)** – Navbar, footer, hubs, and contextual links now connect pillar ↔ use cases ↔ guides, reducing orphan risk and concentrating PageRank.
- **Unclear contact/trust signals (Medium)** – Added contact email/location in footer; expanded About with process/experience; privacy copy clarified data use; unsubscribe set to `noindex`.
- **Missing E-E-A-T authoring (Medium)** – Added pilot framing, operator safety emphasis, and technical rationale to signal expertise; added TechArticle schema.
- **Social preview gaps (Low)** – Added `public/og-default.png` and consistent metadata for OG/Twitter.

## Core Web Vitals / performance
- App is server-rendered; minimal client JS besides form action. No large images or blocking assets detected.
- Quick wins applied: consolidated metadata, avoided client-only routing for critical content, lean styling.
- **Next steps to measure and tune:** run Lighthouse/PageSpeed on `/` and `/ai-dmx-controller` (desktop + mobile) after deploy; monitor INP/LCP/CLS. Add HTTP caching headers via hosting/CDN, ensure image compression if new media is added, and keep JS bundles slim (route-level code only).

## Structured data coverage
- Organization + WebSite: injected globally in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- BreadcrumbList: emitted from `src/components/Breadcrumbs` on every page.
- Product + SoftwareApplication + FAQ: `src/app/ai-dmx-controller/page.tsx`.
- FAQPage: `src/app/faq/page.tsx`.
- TechArticle: `src/app/teknisk/page.tsx`.
- Robots: `/robots.txt` allows all; `/unsubscribe` marked `noindex` via page metadata.

## Content/keyword strategy (implemented)
- Pillar: `/ai-dmx-controller` targets “AI DMX controller” with how-it-works, safety, setup, FAQs, and comparison links.
- Comparisons: `/ai-dmx-controller/alternatives`, `/ai-dmx-controller/vs-maestrodmx`.
- Use cases: `/use-cases/...` (clubs, small venues, beat-synced without programming).
- Guides cluster: `/guides` hub + six supporting articles (basics, addressing, universes, latency/jitter, best practices, troubleshooting).
- Internal linking: hubs link to pillar; pillar links to use cases/guides; nav/footer expose AI DMX, guides, pilot.

## Authority and trust plan
- On-site: clear contact (hello@y-link.no, Oslo), About page with approach and technical notes, privacy policy, pilot expectations, and unsubscribe clarity.
- Off-site (to execute): publish deep technical write-ups (latency budgets, universe planning), share demo videos/code samples, pursue links from lighting communities, partner venues, integrators, and GitHub/docs citations pointing to `/ai-dmx-controller`.

## Open tasks / follow-ups
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the live domain; enforce HTTPS + preferred host redirect at the edge (www vs non-www).
- Run Lighthouse/PageSpeed after deploy; capture before/after CWV for `/` and `/ai-dmx-controller` and log in Search Console.
- Add real social preview assets per page if available (hero/demos); current default OG image is shared across pages.
- If on-site search launches, add WebSite `SearchAction` schema and a `/search` route.
